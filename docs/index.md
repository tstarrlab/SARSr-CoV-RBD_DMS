## Overview 

We performed deep mutational scans to measure the impact on ACE2 binding of all single amino-acid mutations in six sarbecovirus RBD backgrounds. We measured binding affinity (log10Ka) for the ACE2 ortholog from human and six Rhinolophus bats. We also determined mutational effects on RBD expression levels.

Here, we link to two interactive visualizations that enable exploration of the data from these deep mutational scans.


### Instructions 

We have made two tools to help visualize the data from our deep mutational scans:

1. A set of interactive heatmaps that you can use to explore **change** in ACE2-binding affinity caused by mutations in each RBD variant (delta-log10Ka). To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link heatmaps_delta.md %}).

2. A set of interactive heatmaps that you can use to explore the **absolute** ACE2-binding affinity of each RBD variant (log10Ka). To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link heatmaps_absolute.md %}).

### Data

If you are interested in the raw data from our study, you can find the ACE2-binding phenotypes from each experiment [here](https://github.com/tstarrlab/SARSr-CoV-RBD_DMS/tree/main/results/final_variant_scores).
